# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement explainable AI capabilities for wine quality prediction models. The system will train black-box models (LightGBM, XGBoost) on wine datasets and then use interpretability methods (SHAP values and LIME) to explain which features drive quality predictions. This addresses the critical need for model transparency in machine learning applications, allowing users to understand not just what the model predicts, but why it makes those predictions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to train high-performance black-box models on wine data, so that I can achieve the best possible prediction accuracy for wine quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is provided with wine dataset THEN it SHALL train both LightGBM and XGBoost models
2. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance
3. WHEN model training is complete THEN the system SHALL evaluate and report model performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²)
4. WHEN multiple models are trained THEN the system SHALL allow selection of the best performing model for interpretation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to generate SHAP explanations for model predictions, so that I can understand global and local feature importance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a trained model is available THEN the system SHALL generate SHAP values for all predictions
2. WHEN SHAP values are computed THEN the system SHALL create global feature importance plots
3. WHEN analyzing individual predictions THEN the system SHALL generate SHAP waterfall plots showing feature contributions
4. WHEN examining feature interactions THEN the system SHALL create SHAP summary plots with feature value distributions
5. WHEN SHAP analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL save explanations in interpretable formats (plots and data)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to use LIME to explain individual predictions, so that I can understand model behavior for specific wine samples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing individual wine samples THEN the system SHALL generate LIME explanations
2. WHEN LIME explanations are created THEN the system SHALL show which features increase or decrease the predicted quality
3. WHEN explaining predictions THEN the system SHALL provide confidence intervals for feature contributions
4. WHEN multiple samples are analyzed THEN the system SHALL allow comparison of LIME explanations across different wines

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to compare explanations between SHAP and LIME, so that I can validate the consistency of interpretability methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both SHAP and LIME explanations are available THEN the system SHALL create comparison visualizations
2. WHEN comparing methods THEN the system SHALL highlight agreements and disagreements in feature importance
3. WHEN inconsistencies are found THEN the system SHALL provide insights into why methods might differ
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report of interpretation findings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to explore feature interactions and dependencies, so that I can understand complex relationships in wine quality prediction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing feature interactions THEN the system SHALL create SHAP interaction plots
2. WHEN examining feature dependencies THEN the system SHALL generate partial dependence plots
3. WHEN exploring relationships THEN the system SHALL identify the most important feature pairs
4. WHEN interaction analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights about wine chemistry relationships

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to export and save interpretability results, so that I can share findings and integrate them into reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interpretability analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL save all plots as high-quality images
2. WHEN explanations are generated THEN the system SHALL export SHAP values and LIME explanations as structured data
3. WHEN saving results THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive HTML report with all visualizations
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV files with feature importance rankings and values
